# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Rails follows an MVC pattern. What does that mean?

  Your answer: MVC stands for model view controller and it is a software design pattern. I know it breaks things into three components

  Researched answer: It seems that it is a design that divides the related logic into three elements which are the model view and controller. The user sees the view and uses the controller which manipulates the model which when updated changes the view which the uses then sees.



2. What does it mean if an application has CRUD? What does CRUD stand for?

  Your answer: CRUD stands for create, read, update, and delete which are the requirements for a full-stack application

  Researched answer: Pretty much what my answer said but these four functions are considered necessary to implement a persistent storage application.



3. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

  Your answer: Only know that it will most likely have to do with relationship between two different data bases.

  Researched answer: A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data points with defined relationships for easy access. It is also the most widely used database model. The main component is the access to data points that are related to one another.



4. What are the 5 HTTP verbs? What are they important?

  Your answer: I am not sure at all what they are

  Researched answer: They are POST, GET, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These are important because they are the same as the verbs that are in CRUD.



5. What is object-relational mapping?

  Your answer: I know it must do with objects oriented programming but not sure where the relational part comes into play.

  Researched answer: From my understanding it is the use of enwrapped software that translate and manipulates information from a relational database table into an object in Ruby by using ruby on rails



6. What is a gem?

  Your answer: I know that it has to do with Ruby and is like a an addon or plugin that can help extend rubys capabilities.

  Researched answer: Gems are software packages that contain files that will extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications. They are open sourced libaries that contain ruby coded and are packaged with extra data which help add functionality to ruby



7. What are primary keys? Why are they important?

  Your answer: Im sure it has to do with key value pairs in databases

  Researched answer: Primary keys are an existing or created column that will keep a unique identification for all new instances of a class.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
- RESTful routes
Provides mapping between HTTP verbs and CRUD operations in the databases

- JSON
Stands for JavaScript Object Notation and is the name of the structured data based on JavaScript object syntax. Transmit from server and web application

- Endpoints
An endpoint is the one end of a communication channel. This would be the URL of a server or service. An endpoint is also given to device that is at the end point of a network like a laptop or desktop.

- Strong params
From my understanding it sounds like training wheels that keep you from doing certain actions that can potentially harm apps, files, and hardware.

- Validations
This allows a user to ensure that only valid data is stored in the database.
